		<dt>1. When attempting to minimize memory usage, the
  most efficient way to do group processing when  
  using the MEANS procedure is to use:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>A. the BY statement.</p>      
                        <p>B. GROUPBY with the NOTSORTED specification.</p>
                        <p>C. the CLASS statement.</p>   
                        <p>D. multiple WHERE statements. </p>
      
                        <p>Answer: C</p>
                        <p>"By" apply to each variabl, "Class" apply to whole</p>
		</dd>
    
		<dt>5. The SAS data set WORK.CHECK has an index on the variable Code and the following SAS program is submitted. 
 
  proc sort data=WORK.CHECK;    
     by Code; 
  run; 
 
  Which describes the result of submitting     
  the SAS program?:   </dt>
		<dd>
			<p>A. The index on Code is deleted.</p>      
                        <p>B. The index on Code is updated.</p>
                        <p>C. The index on Code is uneffected.</p>   
                        <p>D. The sort does not execute. </p>
      
                        <p>Answer: D</p>
                        <p>Without force not excuete, with index deleted</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>6. The table WORK.PILOTS contains the following data:
 
   WORK.PILOTS
 
   Id   Name     Jobcode  Salary
   ---  ------   -------  ------
   001  Albert   PT1       50000
   002  Brenda   PT1       70000
   003  Carl     PT1       60000
   004  Donna    PT2       80000
   005  Edward   PT2       90000
   006  Flora    PT3      100000
 
 The data set was summarized to include average
 salary based on jobcode:       
 
   Jobcode  Salary     Avg      
   -------  ------   -----      
   PT1       50000   60000      
   PT1       70000   60000      
   PT1       60000   60000      
   PT2       80000   85000      
   PT2       90000   85000      
   PT3      100000  100000      
 
 Which SQL statement could NOT generate  
 this result?
