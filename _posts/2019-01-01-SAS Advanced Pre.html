		<dt>1. When attempting to minimize memory usage, the
  most efficient way to do group processing when  
  using the MEANS procedure is to use:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>A. the BY statement.</p>      
                        <p>B. GROUPBY with the NOTSORTED specification.</p>
                        <p>C. the CLASS statement.</p>   
                        <p>D. multiple WHERE statements. </p>
      
                        <p>Answer: C</p>
                        <p>"By" apply to each variabl, "Class" apply to whole</p>
		</dd>
    
		<dt>5. The SAS data set WORK.CHECK has an index on the variable Code and the following SAS program is submitted. 
 
  proc sort data=WORK.CHECK;    
     by Code; 
  run; 
 
  Which describes the result of submitting     
  the SAS program?:   </dt>
		<dd>
			<p>A. The index on Code is deleted.</p>      
                        <p>B. The index on Code is updated.</p>
                        <p>C. The index on Code is uneffected.</p>   
                        <p>D. The sort does not execute. </p>
      
                        <p>Answer: D</p>
                        <p>Without force not excuete, with index deleted</p>
